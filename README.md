<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Most Important Projects

This specialization involves working on a total of nearly 20 assignments. The following are some of the most important projects:
### Autonomous Driving System

[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anshabhi/Deep-Learning-Coursera/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Week3/Car%20detection%20for%20Autonomous%20Driving/Autonomous%20driving%20application%20-%20Car%20detection%20-%20v1.ipynb)

Use YOLO object detection model to design a model to detect objects on road from a video stream.

### Neural Art Style Transfer
[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anshabhi/Deep-Learning-Coursera/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Week4/Neural%20Style%20Transfer/Art%20Generation%20with%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer%20-%20v1.ipynb)

Use Neural Style Transfer to generate artistic images. Fundamentally, use Transfer Learning on a pre-trained CNN to transfer style from one a drawing to a portrait image.

### Trigger Word Detection
[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anshabhi/Deep-Learning-Coursera/blob/master/Sequence%20Models/Week3/Trigger%20word%20detection/Trigger%20word%20detection%20-%20v1.ipynb)

Design a Sequence model used in personal assistant devices such as Alexa and Siri to respond to a Trigger word.
Each time the user says activate, a chime is played as a trigger. Involves processing audio inputs as train/dev sets.
